# Dungeon-MUD
A text based RPG adventure game

written by RobotJulia

This dungeon crawler was designed to show a few software principles including a combat system, item use, save, load, and leveling up. While a fair effort was put into the story line, this was an earlier adaptation of my programming style. The design pattern was to have each room controlled by a boolean letting the game know where the player is in the game story-line. While the fundamental game mechanics are relatively simple, I believe the story line and game design make it a fun dungeon crawl! :) Can you beat the last boss and make it to *the Arena*?

save often.
